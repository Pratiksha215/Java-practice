Day 5
1. Import day5.1 & day5.2 in your eclipse workspace n revise important topics from day5.1

2. Copy day4_lab project into day5_lab .
Add abstraction.
In Emp class , since there is no formula for sal computation , make the method abstract.

eg : public abstract double computeNetSalary();
Add @Override annotation suitably & test it.

3. Revise important topics from day5.2

4. Solve this.
Create Java application for fixed stack & growable stack based on Stack i/f , for storing emp details

Steps

1.1  Create Employee class -- id,name, constructor,toString
1.2 Stack interface -- push & pop functionality for Emp refs. & declare STACK_SIZE as a constant. 
1.3 Create implementation class of Stack i/f -- FixedStack (array based)

1.4 Create implementation class of Stack i/f-- GrowableStack (array based)

1.5
From tester class (Must use dynamic method dispatch using interfaces)
--- display Menu
(Note : Must use 1 switch-case only.
Should not use any instanceof checking n downcasting)
Once user selects either fixed or growable stack , user shouldn't be allowed to change the selection of the stack.)
Options
1 -- Choose Fixed Stack
2 -- Choose Growable Stack
Accept following options only after initial selection.
3 -- Push data 
4 --- Pop data & display
5 -- Exit
